This is a simple python project to make a small messaging application

Two Componets:
* Server side to connect users and maintain records of communication
* Client Side connect to server and send messages to server

Backend quick reference
-----------------------

Files:
- `backend/server.py` — websocket server implementation (no argparse). Binds to 0.0.0.0:6789 by default.
- `backend/client.py` — minimal python client that connects to the server renders messages, sends messages, and sends commands.

Message model (in-memory): each message is an object with:
- `id` (int): unique incremental id assigned by the server
- `text` (str): message text
- `reply_to` (int|null): id of the message this message replies to (null if not a reply)

Commands supported by the backend (client sends these as plain text over the websocket):
- `/delete <id>` — delete the message with the given id. Also supports `/delete last` to delete the most recent message.
	- On success the server broadcasts `{ "type": "delete", "id": <id> }` to all connected clients.
- `/reply <id> <text>` — create a new message that is a reply to message `<id>`. The server assigns an id and broadcasts
	`{ "type": "message", "id": <new id>, "text": "<text>", "reply_to": <id> }`.
 - `/temp <seconds> <text>` — create a temporary public message that will automatically be deleted after <seconds> seconds. The server
   includes an `expires_at` (epoch seconds) field in the broadcasted message so clients can display expiry info. When the message expires the server
   broadcasts `{ "type": "delete", "id": <id> }`.
 - `/to <client_id> <text>` — send a direct message to the client identified by `<client_id>` (use the client list shown in the UI to pick an id).
 - '/exit' disconnect to server and give up given user name

Normal messages (not starting with `/`) are stored and broadcast as `{ "type": "message", "id": <id>, "text": "<text>", "reply_to": null }`.

Client behavior:
- On connection the server sends an `init` payload with current message history: `{ "type": "init", "messages": [ ... ] }`.
- Clients should render messages, show reply previews when `reply_to` is present, and remove messages on `delete` events.

How to run the backend locally
-------------------------------
1. Ensure you have Python 3 and the `websockets` package installed. Install with:

```bash
python3 -m pip install websockets
```

2. Start the server from the repo root:

```bash
python3 backend/server.py
```

3. Open `front/client.py` in one or more times (or serve it from a static server) to connect to the running server. Use the input box to send messages. To reply or delete messages, either type the command directly (e.g. `/reply 1 Thanks`).

Notes and limitations
---------------------
- Storage is in-memory only; restarting the server clears history.
- There is no authentication or ownership checking: any connected client can delete any message.
